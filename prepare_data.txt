## Data Structuring
JSON Structure:
I created a structured JSON format for each policy set, defining the above attributes.

Conversion to DataFrame:
Using Python's pandas library, I converted each JSON structure to a DataFrame.

Saving as CSV:
I saved each DataFrame as a CSV file.

Combining CSV Files:
Finally, I combined all the individual CSV files into a single CSV file for ease of use.
